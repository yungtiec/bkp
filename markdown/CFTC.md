### Purpose and Functionality

(1) What was the impetus for developing Ether and the Ethereum Network,
especially relative to Bitcoin?

(2) What are the current functionalities and capabilities of Ether and the Ethereum
Network as compared to the functionalities and capabilities of Bitcoin?

(3) How is the developer community currently utilizing the Ethereum Network?
More specifically, what are prominent use cases or examples that demonstrate the
functionalities and capabilities of the Ethereum Network?

(4) Are there any existing or developing commercial enterprises that are using
Ether to power economic transactions? If so, how is Ether recorded for accounting
purposes in a comprehensive set of financial statements?

(5) What data sources, analyses, calculations, variables, or other factors could be
used to determine Ether’s market size, liquidity, trade volume, types of traders,
ownership concentration, and/or principal ways in which the Ethereum Network is
currently being used by market participants?

(6) How many confirmations on the Ethereum blockchain are sufficient to wait to
ensure that the transaction will not end up on an invalid block?


### Technology

(7) How is the technology underlying Ethereum similar to and different from the
technology underlying Bitcoin?

(8) Does the Ethereum Network face scalability challenges? If so, please describe
such challenges and any potential solutions. What analyses or data sources could be used
to assess concerns regarding the scalability of the underlying Ethereum Network, and in
particular, concerns about the network’s ability to support the growth and adoption of
additional smart contracts?

(9) Has a proof of stake consensus mechanism been tested or validated at scale?
If so, what lessons or insights can be learned from the experience?

(10) Relative to a proof of work consensus mechanism does proof of stake have
particular vulnerabilities, challenges, or features that make it prone to manipulation? In
responding consider, for example, that under a proof of stake consensus mechanism, the
chance of validating a block may be proportional to staked wealth.

(11) There are reports of disagreements within the Ether community over the
proposed transition to a proof of stake consensus model. Could this transition from a
proof of work to a proof of stake verification process result in a fragmented or diminished
Ether market if the disagreements are not resolved?

(12) What capability does the Ethereum Network have to support the continued
development and increasing use of smart contracts?

### Governance

(13) How is the governance of the Ethereum Network similar to and different from
the governance of the Bitcoin network?

(14) In light of Ether’s origins as an outgrowth from the Ethereum Classic
blockchain, are there potential issues that could make Ether’s underlying blockchain
vulnerable to future hard forks or splintering?


### Markets, Oversight and Regulation

(15) Are there protections or impediments that would prevent market participants
or other actors from intentionally disrupting the normal function of the Ethereum
Network in an attempt to distort or disrupt the Ether market?

(16) What impediments or risks exist to the reliable conversion of Ether to legal
tender? How do these impediments or risks impact regulatory considerations for
Commission registrants with respect to participating in any transactions in Ether,
including the ability to obtain or demonstrate possession or control or otherwise hold
Ether as collateral or on behalf of customers?

(17) How would the introduction of derivative contracts on Ether potentially
change or modify the incentive structures that underlie a proof of stake consensus model?

(18) Given the evolving nature of the Ether cash markets underlying potential
Ether derivative contracts, what are the commercial risk management needs for a
derivative contract on Ether?

(19) Please list any potential impacts on Ether and the Ethereum Network that may
arise from the listing or trading of derivative contracts on Ether.

(20) Are there any types of trader or intermediary conduct that has occurred in the
international Ether derivative markets that raise market risks or challenges and should be
monitored closely by trading venues or regulators?

(21) What other factors could impact the Commission’s ability to properly oversee
or monitor trading in derivative contracts on Ether as well as the underlying Ether cash
markets?

(22) Are there any emerging best practices for monitoring the Ethereum Network
and public blockchains more broadly?

### Cyber Security and Custody

(23) Are there security issues peculiar to the Ethereum Network or Ethereumsupported
smart contracts that need to be addressed?

(24) Are there any best practices for the construction and security of Ethereum
wallets, including, but not limited to, the number of keys required to sign a transaction
and how access to the keys should be segregated?

(25) Are there any best practices for conducting an independent audit of Ether
deposits?
