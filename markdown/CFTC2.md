# CFTC Request For Input On Crypto-Asset Mechanics And Markets

### Invitation to members of The Brooklyn Project community

>The questions below were originally posted by the CFTC in their “Request For Input On Crypto-Asset Mechanics And Markets” on 11 December 2018, available at https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2018-12/federalregister121118.pdf.

>We are inviting The Brooklyn Project’s community members to debate and comment on these questions. We will leave the comment period open for 10 days; after which we will consolidate the community’s comments and draft our official response.

>None of the content on this webpage creates an attorney-client relationship or privilege with or among anyone, and no one should rely on any of the information here for legal advice. You should always consult and rely upon your own legal counsel for legal advice.

> Note: Another, separate community-driven collaboration can be found here: https://github.com/ethhub-io/ethhub/blob/master/other/ethhub-cftc-response.md. We encourage the community to collaborate in any and all forums; we'll be monitoring the Ethhub collaboration and likely will incorporate material from there, too, in our response to the CFTC.

### Purpose and Functionality

section

### (1) What was the impetus for developing Ether and the Ethereum Network, especially relative to Bitcoin?

The Ethereum Network and its “crypto-fuel,” ether, were originally conceived by 19-year old, Vitalik Buterin, and brought to life by a large and dispersed ecosystem of developers, miners, academics, and innovators.

**Ethereum Network.** Buterin began formulating his vision for Ethereum after Bitcoin became the first successful “crypto-currency.” Bitcoin proved that an open, decentralized network could transfer and keep track of value through an open “consensus” algorithm. See (https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper.) In late 2013, Vitalik began envisioning an improved platform for building “programmable money,” where parties could enter blockchain-based “contracts” holding digital assets and transfer those assets according to pre-set rules. (See https://vitalik.ca/2017-09-15-prehistory.html.)

Buterin first published his vision for Ethereum in December 2013. Many people all around the world were inspired by and began collaborating with Vitalik on his vision. These collaborations led to expanding, modifying and refining the specifics of the Ethereum “protocol,” as well as transitioning Ethereum from a platform for “programmable money” to one for general computation – i.e., allowing anyone to create and run any type of code through “smart contracts” on the Ethereum blockchain, similar to a shared world computer. (See https://vitalik.ca/2017-09-15-prehistory.html.)

**Ether.** From the start, the Ethereum protocol was designed to rely heavily upon ether as a “cryptofuel” native to the Ethereum blockchain for accomplishing two necessary objectives: (1) to serve as fuel in order to pay for resources on the Ethereum blockchain; and (2) to serve as the “reward” in the Ethereum Network’s crypto-economic system.

Ether was designed as a “fuel” for paying fees in order to allocate resources efficiently across the Ethereum Network. The Ethereum protocol requires every computational step of a transaction or smart contract to pay a dynamic and variable fee – called “gas” – that is payable only with ether. (See https://blockgeeks.com/guides/ethereum-gas-step-by-step-guide/.) This was a “crucial” aspect of the Ethereum protocol, because without these gas fees, “members of the network could choke the network with spurious requests including infinite loops that would prevent smart contracts from executing.” (See https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3048104 at 19.)

Ether’s role as the cornerstone of a crypto-economic system was designed to enable the Ethereum Network to operate even though it would require coordination and cooperation of an unlimited number of actors who would not know or necessarily trust each other. In short, “cryptoeconomics is the use of incentives and cryptography to design new kinds of systems, applications, and networks.” (See https://medium.com/l4-media/making-sense-of-cryptoeconomics-c6455776669.) The Ethereum protocol was designed to distribute ether to miners as a reward for them adding new blocks of transactions to the blockchain.

### (4) Are there any existing or developing commercial enterprises that are using Ether to power economic transactions? If so, how is Ether recorded for accounting purposes in a comprehensive set of financial statements?

(Answer)

### (5) What data sources, analyses, calculations, variables, or other factors could be used to determine Ether’s market size, liquidity, trade volume, types of traders, ownership concentration, and/or principal ways in which the Ethereum Network is currently being used by market participants?

(Answer)

### (6) How many confirmations on the Ethereum blockchain are sufficient to wait to ensure that the transaction will not end up on an invalid block?

(Answer)

### Technology

section

### (7) How is the technology underlying Ethereum similar to and different from the technology underlying Bitcoin?

(Answer)

### 8) Does the Ethereum Network face scalability challenges? If so, please describe such challenges and any potential solutions. What analyses or data sources could be used to assess concerns regarding the scalability of the underlying Ethereum Network, and in particular, concerns about the network’s ability to support the growth and adoption of additional smart contracts?

(Answer)

### (9) Has a proof of stake consensus mechanism been tested or validated at scale? If so, what lessons or insights can be learned from the experience?

(Answer)

### (10) Relative to a proof of work consensus mechanism does proof of stake have particular vulnerabilities, challenges, or features that make it prone to manipulation? In responding consider, for example, that under a proof of stake consensus mechanism, the chance of validating a block may be proportional to staked wealth.

(Answer)

### (11) There are reports of disagreements within the Ether community over the proposed transition to a proof of stake consensus model. Could this transition from a proof of work to a proof of stake verification process result in a fragmented or diminished Ether market if the disagreements are not resolved?

(Answer)

### (12) What capability does the Ethereum Network have to support the continued development and increasing use of smart contracts?

(Answer)
