SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

### I. Background

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A. Introduction

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The CEA grants the Commission regulatory authority over the commodity futures
markets.[\[2\]](#_ftn2)
 LabCFTC was launched by the Commission in order to further the CFTC’s
goal of evolving as a 21st century regulator and keeping pace with technological
innovation. LabCFTC is dedicated to facilitating market-enhancing financial technology
(“FinTech”) innovation, informing policy, and ensuring that we have the regulatory and
technological tools and understanding to keep pace with changing markets. LabCFTC is
designed to make the CFTC more accessible to all innovators and to inform the
Commission’s understanding of emerging technologies and their regulatory implications.
One such area of emerging innovation involves virtual currencies.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In further advancing its mission, LabCFTC published a primer on the topic of
virtual currencies in October 2017 (the “Primer”) in order to help educate the public on
potential applications and use-cases, the CFTC’s role and jurisdictional oversight, and
potential risks and challenges that investors and users may face involving virtual
currencies.[\[3\]](#_ftn3)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In December 2017, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (“CME”) and the
                            CBOE Futures Exchange (“CFE”) self-certified and began offering new contracts for
                            bitcoin futures products following discussions with Commission staff regarding
                            compliance with the CEA and Commission rules and regulations. In line with Chairman
                            Giancarlo’s repeated statements[\[4\]](#_ftn4) regarding the unique nature and risks of virtual
                            currency-related products, the CFTC’s Division of Market Oversight (“DMO”) and
                            Division of Clearing and Risk (“DCR”) issued on May 21, 2018 a joint staff advisory[\[5\]](#_ftn5)
                            that gives exchanges and clearinghouses registered with the CFTC guidance on certain
                            enhancements when listing a derivative contract based on virtual currency pursuant to
                            Commission regulations. The input being sought here will better inform the Commission
                            and its operating divisions as the market evolves and potentially seeks to list new virtual
                            currency based futures and derivatives products.
                            
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B. &nbsp; &nbsp; Bitcoin as a Virtual Currency

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In its October 2017 Primer, LabCFTC cited the IRS to define a virtual currency as
“a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of
account, and/or a store of value . . . [but that\] does not have legal tender status.”[\[6\]](#_ftn6)
 The
Primer further noted key characteristics of Bitcoin, including that it:

- Is “pseudonymous” (or partially anonymous) in that an individual is identified
by an alpha-numeric public key/address;
- Relies on cryptography (and unique digital signatures) for security based on
public and private keys and complex mathematical algorithms;
- Runs on a decentralized peer-to-peer network of computers and “miners” that
operate on open-source software and do “work” to validate and irrevocably log
transactions on a permanent public distributed ledger visible to the entire network;
- Solves the lack of trust between participants who may be strangers to each
other on a public ledger through the transaction validation work noted in the bullet above;
and
- Enables the transfer of ownership without the need for a trusted, central
intermediary.

The Primer noted potential applications or use cases of a virtual currency like Bitcoin,
including that it may serve as a store of value, be used for trading, enable payments and
value transfers, power applications built upon the virtual currency network, and facilitate
money transfers or international remittances. The Primer further highlighted a range of
potential risks around virtual currencies, including technology, operational, cybersecurity,
speculative, and fraud and manipulation risks.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C. &nbsp; &nbsp; Ether as a Virtual Currency

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In June 2018, the Director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”)
Division of Corporation Finance, Bill Hinman, delivered a speech which conveyed Mr.
Hinman’s personal views. In the speech, he addressed the question of whether “a digital
asset that was originally offered in a securities offering [could\] ever be later sold in a 
6
manner that does not constitute an offering of a security.” He explained among other
factors that since the network on which Bitcoin operates appears to be decentralized and
there is no central third party whose efforts are a key determining factor in the success of
Bitcoin, “[a\]pplying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to the offer and
resale of Bitcoin would seem to add little value.” He further stated that, in addition to
Bitcoin, “based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network
and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities
transactions.” Finally, he stated that “[o\]ver time, there may be other sufficiently
decentralized networks and systems where regulating the tokens or coins that function on
them as securities may not be required.”[\[7\]](#_ftn7)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ether is a virtual currency that was launched on the Ethereum Network in 2015.
It is an open network that currently relies on a proof of work consensus mechanism, but
developers, including through the Ethereum Foundation, have plans to shift the protocol
to a proof of stake consensus model in order, at least in part, to reduce energy
consumption required to validate the ledger.[\[8\]](#_ftn8)
 The Ethereum Network is often viewed as
a platform that permits ready creation and use of smart contracts that can power
decentralized applications or organizations. In this way, Ether is used as “fuel” to
compensate miners for maintaining a public ledger for such networks.[\[9\]](#_ftn9) To date, Ether
has typically been one of the top three virtual currencies by market capitalization.

### II. Request for Input

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Commission is seeking public feedback namely on Ether and the Ethereum
Network in order to better understand these technologies given Ether’s size in the market
and potentially unique attributes relative to Bitcoin. The Commission is issuing this RFI
in order to gather public feedback on a range of questions related to the underlying
technology, opportunities, risks, mechanics, use cases, and markets, related to Ether and
the Ethereum Network. The requested information will inform the work of LabCFTC
and the Commission as a whole. The Commission welcomes any relevant comments,
including related topics that may not be specifically mentioned but which a commenter
believes should be considered.

_Specific Questions for Input_

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to any general input, the Commission is interested in responses to the
following questions:

**Purpose and Functionality**

1. What was the impetus for developing Ether and the Ethereum Network,
especially relative to Bitcoin?
2. What are the current functionalities and capabilities of Ether and the Ethereum
Network as compared to the functionalities and capabilities of Bitcoin?
3. How is the developer community currently utilizing the Ethereum Network?
More specifically, what are prominent use cases or examples that demonstrate the
functionalities and capabilities of the Ethereum Network?
8
4. Are there any existing or developing commercial enterprises that are using
Ether to power economic transactions? If so, how is Ether recorded for accounting
purposes in a comprehensive set of financial statements?
5. What data sources, analyses, calculations, variables, or other factors could be
used to determine Ether’s market size, liquidity, trade volume, types of traders,
ownership concentration, and/or principal ways in which the Ethereum Network is
currently being used by market participants?
6. How many confirmations on the Ethereum blockchain are sufficient to wait to
ensure that the transaction will not end up on an invalid block?

**Technology**

7. How is the technology underlying Ethereum similar to and different from the
technology underlying Bitcoin?
8. Does the Ethereum Network face scalability challenges? If so, please describe
such challenges and any potential solutions. What analyses or data sources could be used
to assess concerns regarding the scalability of the underlying Ethereum Network, and in
particular, concerns about the network’s ability to support the growth and adoption of
additional smart contracts?
9. Has a proof of stake consensus mechanism been tested or validated at scale?
If so, what lessons or insights can be learned from the experience?
10. Relative to a proof of work consensus mechanism does proof of stake have
particular vulnerabilities, challenges, or features that make it prone to manipulation? In
responding consider, for example, that under a proof of stake consensus mechanism, the
chance of validating a block may be proportional to staked wealth.
9
11. There are reports of disagreements within the Ether community over the
proposed transition to a proof of stake consensus model. Could this transition from a
proof of work to a proof of stake verification process result in a fragmented or diminished
Ether market if the disagreements are not resolved?
12. What capability does the Ethereum Network have to support the continued
development and increasing use of smart contracts?

**Governance**

13. How is the governance of the Ethereum Network similar to and different from
the governance of the Bitcoin network?
14. In light of Ether’s origins as an outgrowth from the Ethereum Classic
blockchain, are there potential issues that could make Ether’s underlying blockchain
vulnerable to future hard forks or splintering?

**Markets, Oversight and Regulation**

15. Are there protections or impediments that would prevent market participants
or other actors from intentionally disrupting the normal function of the Ethereum
Network in an attempt to distort or disrupt the Ether market?
16. What impediments or risks exist to the reliable conversion of Ether to legal
tender? How do these impediments or risks impact regulatory considerations for
Commission registrants with respect to participating in any transactions in Ether,
including the ability to obtain or demonstrate possession or control or otherwise hold
Ether as collateral or on behalf of customers?
17. How would the introduction of derivative contracts on Ether potentially
change or modify the incentive structures that underlie a proof of stake consensus model?
10
18. Given the evolving nature of the Ether cash markets underlying potential
Ether derivative contracts, what are the commercial risk management needs for a
derivative contract on Ether?
19. Please list any potential impacts on Ether and the Ethereum Network that may
arise from the listing or trading of derivative contracts on Ether.
20. Are there any types of trader or intermediary conduct that has occurred in the
international Ether derivative markets that raise market risks or challenges and should be
monitored closely by trading venues or regulators?
21. What other factors could impact the Commission’s ability to properly oversee
or monitor trading in derivative contracts on Ether as well as the underlying Ether cash
markets?
22. Are there any emerging best practices for monitoring the Ethereum Network
and public blockchains more broadly?

**Cyber Security and Custody**

23. Are there security issues peculiar to the Ethereum Network or Ethereumsupported
smart contracts that need to be addressed?
24. Are there any best practices for the construction and security of Ethereum
wallets, including, but not limited to, the number of keys required to sign a transaction
and how access to the keys should be segregated?
25. Are there any best practices for conducting an independent audit of Ether
deposits?
In providing your responses, please be as specific as possible, and offer concrete
examples where appropriate. Please provide any relevant data to support your answers 
11
where appropriate. The Commission encourages all relevant comments on related items
or issues; commenters need not address every question.
